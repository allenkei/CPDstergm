Description: This package perform the change point detection task under the Separable Temporal Exponential-family Random Graph Model. We propose an estimator based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and Group Lasso to simultaneously detect multiple time points, where the parameters of STERGM shift. We also provide Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as model selection to assist the detection.
