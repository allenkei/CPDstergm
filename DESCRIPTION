Description: This package detects multiple change points simultaneously in a sequence of temporal and dyadic dependent networks, under the Separable Temporal Exponential-family Random Graph Model. The observed networks are assumed to be generated from piecewise constant distributions but altered at unknown change points. Detection of the change points in these dynamic networks has a wide range of applications. Moreover, the Separable Temporal Exponential-family Random Graph Model (STERGM) is a flexible model to represent both dyadic and temporal dependencies of networks that evolve. We propose an estimator based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and Group Lasso to simultaneously detect multiple time points, where the parameters of STERGM shift. We also provide Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as model selection to assist the detection.
